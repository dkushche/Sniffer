# Sniffer

Welcome. Here is the basic network sniffer with cli application. This project was my first step in begging of my Embedded Engineer career. Here I met interfaces, syscalls that I never used before, created my first daemon, and more. This project gave me my first serious job and was the start point in my journey in the world of embedded systems. I didn't change any directory structure or source code to save historical reference even if it looks messy and a bit stupid.
